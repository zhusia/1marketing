// Monotonic max-seen-timestamp helper — Workstream A / roadmap #8, phase P0.
// Closes §4.4 hole #3: "Clock rollback + firewall block = permanent Pro."
// Get a valid entitlement, set the clock to 2020, block the domain → `notAfter`
// never passes. Individually survivable; combined they are a complete bypass.
//
// The defense: persist the GREATEST timestamp ever observed (each entitlement's
// `issuedAt`, each successful refresh, and `now` on every boot). Refuse to verify
// when `now` is meaningfully behind it.
//
// This module is PURE — just the max/compare logic. Persisting the max across
// launches (disk / store) is a later phase (P2); these functions take the prior
// max in and hand the new max back so the caller owns storage.
